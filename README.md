In this project, I built a website which shows many kind of photos. And it provide some examples of the photographs that the photographer has taken in the deserts of Morroco. This application is made with `HTML`, `CSS` and `SASS`.

![MY photograph](./webroot/images/photograph-page.webp)

## Functionality
  - Clean consistent accessible HTML.
  - Progressively enhancing my HTML, e.g. using `<picture>` elements with multiple sources.
  - Clean SASS to implement DRY styling. I used variables to extend mixins, functions and abstract classes.
  - Added style to elements that the user can focus, hover over, or interact with.
  - Responsive design and using Custom Properties.
  - I compressed the images to make the page load faster.
  - I used WOFF2 and WOFF for the fonts formats. 
  - I made the menu the mobile responsive and used WEBP as my image format.

## Built With

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   SASS
